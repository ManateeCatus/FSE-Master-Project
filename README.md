This application is designed to help recovering stroke patients redevelop fine motor skills. It has 3 different exercises designed to help.


  Exercise 1: Line Rider
    The user must click and drag a circle to trace a line. They are given points based on how closely they manage to follow the line.
    
  Exercise 2: Bubble Popper
    The user must click the bubbles as they appear, which will lower the number on them by 1, until the number on them reaches 0. 
    The color of each bubble will change to red over time, until they dissapear.
    Points are gained by popping the circles, with more points given if no bubbles dissappear due to time.
   
  Exercise 3: Circle Stacker
    The user must move the circles to stack them all on top of each other.
    Points are lost while a circle is dragged, and the goal is to have the highest amount of points while all circles are stacked.
